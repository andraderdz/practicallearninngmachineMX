## Summary


In this document we will develope a Machine Learning algorythm to analyse devices known as Human Activity Recognition Technology, that recolect multiple activities of a person along the day.The presented collected data is about **5 activities or classes** (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting). So we will use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to try to predict if they do the activity in a wrong way.

The training data for this project are available here:

<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv>

The test data are available here:

<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv>


## Data Decision

To get to know more about what variables we should use we have read the complete description for this project from the next source: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>. After analysis we have decided to focus in the next body parts and sensors:


```{r out.width = "250px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/Ricardo/Desktop/Coursera/Data Science Specialization/Machine Learnin/Project/on-body-sensing-schema.png")
```

We considered the arm, belt, forearm and dumbbell as variables that affected more in the exercise process, we use the follow asociated variables:  the accelerometer and the gyroscope both in their 3 respective dimesions (x,y,z), that is a total of 36 variables to predict (plus de classe which is the variable we want to predict)

## Subsetting

After reading (loading) the original data, the result of the subsetting it is the next:

```{r eval=FALSE}

training2<-training[,
c("accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z",
  "accel_forearm_x","accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z",
  "gyros_arm_x","gyros_arm_y","gyros_arm_z",
  "gyros_forearm_x","gyros_forearm_y","gyros_forearm_z",
  "accel_belt_x", "accel_belt_y", "accel_belt_z",
  "gyros_belt_x", "gyros_belt_y", "gyros_belt_z",
  "accel_dumbbell_x", "accel_dumbbell_y", "accel_dumbbell_z",
  "gyros_dumbbell_x", "gyros_dumbbell_y", "gyros_dumbbell_z",
  "classe")]

testing2<-testing[,
c( "accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z",
"accel_belt_x","accel_belt_y","accel_belt_z",
"accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_z",
"accel_forearm_x", "accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z")]

```

## Overview for the chosen variables

For reasons of time, we decided to do a little nearZeroVar check for the variables, so make sure that apport meaningful data to the model.

```{r eval=FALSE}
>library(caret)
> nearZeroVar(training2,saveMetrics=T)
                 freqRatio percentUnique zeroVar   nzv
accel_arm_x       1.017341     3.9598410   FALSE FALSE
accel_arm_y       1.140187     2.7367241   FALSE FALSE
accel_arm_z       1.128000     4.0362858   FALSE FALSE
accel_belt_x      1.055412     0.8357966   FALSE FALSE
accel_belt_y      1.113725     0.7287738   FALSE FALSE
accel_belt_z      1.078767     1.5237998   FALSE FALSE
accel_dumbbell_x  1.018018     2.1659362   FALSE FALSE
accel_dumbbell_y  1.053061     2.3748853   FALSE FALSE
accel_dumbbell_z  1.133333     2.0894914   FALSE FALSE
accel_forearm_x   1.126437     4.0464784   FALSE FALSE
accel_forearm_y   1.059406     5.1116094   FALSE FALSE
accel_forearm_z   1.006250     2.9558659   FALSE FALSE
classe            1.469581     0.0254816   FALSE FALSE
```


We decided to choose a SVM model because of the large amount of variables and data, models like random forest and Trees were tested and resulting in really bad Accuracies (0<0.55) and a large amount of time.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Model - SVM
svmmodFit<-svm(classe ~.,data = training2)
```
Since we do not have a testing set that includes the real response, we will compare our model to the train data to chek the result of accuracy
```{r eval=FALSE}
> predict1<-predict(svmmodFit,training2)
> confusionMatrix(predict1,training2$classe)
Confusion Matrix and Statistics

          Reference
Prediction    A    B    C    D    E
         A 4943  454  320  325   79

         E   26  110   42   38 2945

Overall Statistics
                                          
               Accuracy : 0.8172
```

As we can see the accuracy is a very good value of **0.817**, so we decided to do a further investigation for the variables, so we can add a few more. Since we consider that may be an important movement of the body we decided to add the **pitch value variables** to the SVM model ("pitch_arm", "pitch_belt", "pitch_dumbbell", "pitch_forearm"). The new data sets and model are as follows

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Model2 - SVM
training4<-training[,
                    c( "accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z",
                       "accel_belt_x","accel_belt_y","accel_belt_z",
                       "accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_z",
                       "accel_forearm_x", "accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z",
                       "pitch_arm","pitch_belt","pitch_dumbbell","pitch_forearm","classe")]

testing4<-testing[,
                  c( "accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z",
                     "accel_belt_x","accel_belt_y","accel_belt_z",
                     "accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_z",
                     "accel_forearm_x", "accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z",
                     "pitch_arm","pitch_belt","pitch_dumbbell","pitch_forearm")]
svmmodFit2<-svm(classe ~.,data = training4)
```

## Accuracy for the Second Model

Now we look for the Accuracy of this new model
```{r eval=FALSE}
predict4<-predict(svmmodFit2,training4)
confusionMatrix(predict4,training4$classe)
> confusionMatrix(predict4,training4$classe)
Confusion Matrix and Statistics

         C  152  206 3100  338  171
         D   82   63   57 2742  177
         E   23   67   33   24 3143

Overall Statistics
                                          
               Accuracy : 0.8765 
```

This new models is quite good, but not enough predicting force. So we will build a new model.

## Accuracy for the Final Model

Now we will consider to extend the model and include the gyroscope, yaw, pitch and roll variables. 

```{r eval=FALSE}

training_3<-training[,
c("accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z",
  "accel_forearm_x","accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z",

  "yaw_arm","yaw_belt","yaw_dumbbell","yaw_forearm",
  "pitch_arm","pitch_belt","pitch_dumbbell","pitch_forearm",
  "roll_arm","roll_belt","roll_dumbbell","roll_forearm",
  "classe")]

testing3<-testing[,
c("accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z",
  "accel_forearm_x","accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z",
  "gyros_arm_x","gyros_arm_y","gyros_arm_z",
  "gyros_forearm_x","gyros_forearm_y","gyros_forearm_z",
  "accel_belt_x", "accel_belt_y", "accel_belt_z",
  "gyros_belt_x", "gyros_belt_y", "gyros_belt_z",
  "accel_dumbbell_x", "accel_dumbbell_y", "accel_dumbbell_z",
  "gyros_dumbbell_x", "gyros_dumbbell_y", "gyros_dumbbell_z",
  "yaw_arm","yaw_belt","yaw_dumbbell","yaw_forearm",
  "pitch_arm","pitch_belt","pitch_dumbbell","pitch_forearm",
  "roll_arm","roll_belt","roll_dumbbell","roll_forearm")]

```

```

Let's build the model and look for the Accuracy of this new model

```{r eval=FALSE}
predict4<-predict(svmmodFit2,training4)
confusionMatrix(predict4,training4$classe)
> confusionMatrix(predict4,training4$classe)
Confusion Matrix and Statistics

          Reference

         C   15   88 3284  302   92
         D    9    7   47 2895   59

Overall Statistics
                                          
               Accuracy : 0.9465
```

This is a quite and very good accuracy and for reasons of time we will stop the analysis here and proceed to forecast for the final quizz.


## The final Quizz

The forecast for the final quizz is the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
> predict(svmmodFit2,testing4)
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
 B  A  A  A  A  E  D  B  A  A  B  C  B  A  E  E  A  B  B  B 
Levels: A B C D E
```

And the resulting score for the quizz is **95%**.
